## PART OF THE ELECTRIC_TERRARIUM PROJECT 
### BY EARL THIBEAULT
WELL THIS IIS THE MSG_SKL OR MSG FORMAT HOWEVER YOU PREFER TO THINK OF IT I GEUSS FOR THE ELECTRIC_TERRARIUM PROJECT ET BEING BOTH MY AND THE PROJECTSA INTIALS
PH STANDING FOR PHONE ITS A REFRENCE TOA MOVIE THAT KIDS TODAY IE PEPOLE WHO MAY REED THIS DOCUMENT OR A LATER VERSION OF IT MAY NOT GET BUT THERE YA GO.
THIS SYSTEM USES UDP DATAGRAMS TO PASS ORDERS AND DATA AROUND IN A COMPRESSED FORMAT ITS KINDA AN ADHOC SYSTEM AS ITS A LITTLE JURY-RIGED NOT SO MUCH MODULER AS PICED 
TOGETHER RLLY IM TRYING TO MINIMIZE UDP ISSUE OF UNRELYABILTY BY USEING MSG RESENDS AND MAKEING THE MOST COMPACT MSG POSSIBLE LOWERING METWORK CONGESTION AND REDUCING PROSSESING POWER REQUIRED THAT IS SAID AT THIS POINT TO EXPLAIN SOME DESGIN CHOICES.
1 YWES WHERE USEING THE ADRESSES AND PORTS AND LENGTH AND CHECKSUM FROM THE EXISTING HEADERS CUS WHY NOT DO WE RLLY NEED TO REPEAT THE IP ADRESS MULTIBLE TIMES NO 
2 HUMAN READABLE NOT RLLY YA YOU CAN DECIFER THE MSG BUT YA IF YA PLAYED WITH WIRESHARK ENOUGH ITS A SERILIZED DATA FORMAT THAT IM CURENTLY USEING MSGPACK SERILIZATION 
BUT IM USEING  SCHEMA FOR IT JASONNET JSONSCHEMA STYLE THE MSG HEADER IS LAID OUT AS SUCH EIGHT BIT MSG_TYPE EIGHT BIT EXP_TYPE WHITCH IS JUST WHAT MSG TYPE IS EXPECTED IN IN RESPOSE SAME NUMBERS NOTHER EIGHT BIT MSG_NUMBER WITCH IS JUST COUNT OF MSG IN TTHE CNVO STARTING AT 1 THEN A 4 BIT TELLING WHAT SERILIZER IS BEING USED MSGPACK WOULD BE 1 0 WILL BE IF YA JUST USEING RAW BINARY WICH I GEUSS IS DOABLE SERILIZORS NEED TO ADD IN EXTRA FOR VARIUS RESONS AND WHILE SAY JUST SERILIZING THIS HEADER IN RAW THAT BE EASY TO DO ONCE YA GET INTO ALL THE PAYLOAD OPTIONS IN THIS WORLD IT BECOMES EITHER A RESTICTIVE OR B COMPLICATED BUT IS DOABLE FOR A MODUAL OR USE CASE IF YA SO DESIRE 
THE OTHER 4 BITS ARE FOR MSG SCHHEMA NUMBER WITCH RLLY 
 PADDING  A BOOLEEAN FOR PAYLOAD YES THERE IS ONE OR THERE AINT THATS A BIT FINALY 7 OR 15 BIT CONVO NUMBER COULD BE RANDOMLY GENRATED PROMATICLY GENRATED OR JUST SEQWNTULY JUST AS LONG AS THERE ARE UNIQE  BECAUSE THATS HOW WE KEEP TRACK OF BOTH SUBJECT AND WELL EVERYTHING 8+8+8+4+8+1+11 OR 42 OR  50 BITS  AND FOR ACK.ACK OR A RSP.CMP THAT BE IT   
## IP_HEASDER 1
{NOT DONE YET GOING TO BE REFRENCE TO EXSTING AND REMINDER TO SAVE THE IP ADDRS WATNOT}
## UDP_HEADER 2
{NOT DONE SAME BASIC STORY AD THE IP HEADER JUST SOME POINTS REMBER THAT ALL PARTS OF THIS HEADER ARE NEEDED}
## MSG_STRING 3
### MSG_TYPE 3.1
FIRST OCT OF THE MSG NUMBER
COMBANATION OF 2 OCTAL NUMBERS SO 0-7 FIRST SET IS THE NSG TYPE SECOND SET IS GONNA BE EXP ACK SAME NUMBERS OR AT LEAST ALL OFF THE EXP MESSGES ARE INCLUDED IN THE MSG TYPE SOME OF THEM DONT MAKE SENCE TO BE EXPECTED RETURN MESSAGES 
=== 
#### TYPE RQT 3.1.1
MSG THAT ALWATS COMES FROM THE TIMEKEEPER/ TASKMASTER GOING TO FEILD UNITS IN SOME CASEES IT MAY BE  A MSG THAT IS BEING
FORWARDED FROM USER BUT FOR SIMPLICTY SAKE SOURCE IS THE ORIGEN OF THE MSG ITSELF SO IT ALWAYS COMES FROM THE TIMEKEEPER /TASKMASTER
AND HAS BASE VALUE OF 10 OFFIAL SUB TYPES ARE AS FOLLOWS.
===
1 **TYPE RQT.RPT 3.1.1.1**:
- TECHNICLY IN MOST CASES THIS IS STILL A CMD BUT ITS A REQUWART FOR DATA THE PAYLOAD GONA HAVE RPT.EXPT.ITEAMS AND RPT.EXPT.TIME /
UNLESS ACK.RPT IS EXPECTED THEN IT GOING TO BE INSTINT IN WITCH CASE JUST LEVE THE TIME_FRAME SECTION OF PAYLOAD BE PADDING 
- STARTS NEW CONV
-  DEPENDING ON A FEW FACTORS IF YOU EXPECT ACK.RPT EXPECT LEAST SOME WARNINGS AMD ERRS ON ENVEN THE MOST ERLLL TUNED SETUPS
- VALUE **10**
2 **TYPE RQT.CMD 3.1.1.2**:
- I SUGEST ALWAYS REQUIREING A COMPLETION RPT AND THAT WOULD BE A GUIDE LINE FFOR A MORE FAULT PROOF FRAME WORK \
YOU COULD ALSO NOT REQUIRE IT AND REUEST AN UPDATE AT A LATEE TIME OR A RQT.RPT LATER BUT I THINK ITS SLOOPY  AND SYSTEM WASNT DESIGNED FOR IT
- STARTS NEW CONV
- VALUE **15**
- PAYLOADS GONNA CONTAIN A TSDKLIDY AND A TIMEFRAME ID KEEP THINGS SIMPLE SEND MORE SHORT CMD THEN SSEND SOME CRAZY  TASK LIST AMD A HALF HOUR TIME FRAME GIVES YA \
MORE CONTROLE AND MAKES IT EASYIER TO FOIND ERRORS 
3 **TYPE RQT.UPT 3.1.1.3**:
- ID ONLY USE THIS IN CASE OF AND ELAPSED TIME FRAME AND I WULD ALSO RAISE A WARNING EVEN IF ACK COMES WITH ORIGANELY RQT RPT IT WAS STILL LATE
- NEVER STARTS A CNVO SO KEEP THE CONV NUMBER 
- VALUE **17**
- PAYLLOAD IS WELL RLLY ITS NOT STRICTLY REQUIRED YOU COULD JUST SEN AN EMPTY UPT BUT USE CASES VARRY SOME BUT THIS CAN BE ABUSED SO WATCH YA UPTS
=== 
#### TYPE ACK 3.1.2
THIS IS THE  ACKNOWLEDGMENT SENT UON RECIVING A MSG ALL MSGS EXPCT A ACK IF DEPENDING ON THE LATENCY OF YOUTR SYSTEM YOUR RES.RTE RATE AND RST.CNT 
SHOULD BE SET IN A WAY SO NORMALY YOU DONT HAVE TO RESEND MUCH BASICLY IF YOUR RESENDING ALL THE TIME AND GETTING YOUR ACK A FEW MILL SECONDS AFRTER THE 
RESEND YOUR CLUTTERING UP YOUR LINES AND MAKEING MORE WORK ON TH\AT NOTE SETTING GLOABLE RES.RTE MAY NOT BE THE BEST IDEA BUT IN SOME SITUATIONS NEAR IDEAL ONES 
IN A PERFECT WORLD YA WOULDNT NEES RESENDS
=== 
1 **TYPE ACK.RPT 3.1.2.1**:
- THIS ONES A DANGERUS ONE CAN CAUSE ERRORS SINCE YOUR BASICLY DELAYING THE ACK TO MAKE THE RPT IDK IF IT WORKS IT WORKS BUT SINCE WORKING IN EVERY SITUATION IS THE END GOAL ID LIMIT THE ACK.RPT CUSA NEWTWORK LAG OR LONG END PROSSESING TIME AND YA GONA CAUSE RESENDS AND ECT 
- ACK NEVER ARE NEW CNVO THIS ONE CLOSES CNVO THOU O ANOTHER PROBLEM IS INCLUDEING TBE REPORT IN THE ACK MEANS THERES NO ACK IN RESP BUT YA CAN RESEND AFTER A RECIVING A RESEBD OF THE RQT BUT ONCE AGAIN THAT MAY MAKE MORE EXESS TRAFIC AND SUCH AS ID SAY MOSTLY YA CAN IGNORE FIRST RESEND JUST ASSUME YOUR ACK WAS BIT SLOW WOULDNT EVEN LOG IT ON FEILD UNIT SIDE ATLEAST NOT IN PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS YOU CAN TRACE THEM SERVER SIDE PRETY EASY WHY CLOG LOGS
- PAYLOAD IS RPT SAME AS RSP.RPT JUST FILL IN THE BLANKS OF THE RQT.RPT OH LAST WARNING EXPECT ERRORS 
- VALUE **21** BLACKJACK
2 **TYPE ACK.WAIT 3.1.2.2**:
- THIS IS SAFER IN MY OPION LESS PROBLEMS IF YOUR TIMEFRAMES ARE BEING OVER RUN CONSTINTLY INCRESSINGN THEM IS THE ONLY NON HARDWARE SOLOTION UNLESS YOU GOT SOME TASK OPTIMIZATION TO DO BUT REMBER YA DONT WANT TO GIVE TO LOSE TIMEFRAME I MEAN IT MAY BE FINE BUT IT MAY CAUSE UNDERLYING ISSUES TO GO UN SEEN FAILING HARDWARWE ECT 
- PAYLOAD WILL EOTHER BE EMPTY OR JUST TIMEFRAME RETURNED BUT ID SAY JUST LEAVE IT EMPTY UNLESS YOUR ADJUSTING THE TIME FRAME WITCH I MEAN RLLY THAT SHOULD BE SET TIMEKEEPER SIDE BUT I GEUSS ITS A FIX ID SAY LOOK FOIR A BETTER ONE THOU BUT LIMP ON TILLL THEN

- ID SAY ITS ALWAYS A CNVO ENDER YA COULD HAVE A RPT FOLLOW I MAY PUT IN AN ACK WARNING FOR THIS LATER THESE SHOULD BE ON TOP OF YOUR ERR PILE CAUSE SINCE ACKKNOWLEGEMENT
COMES RIGHT AFTER RECIVELE IT MEANS WAT EVER CMD OR RPT WAS REQESTED NO ATEMPT WAS RLLY MADE SO SOMETHINGS F#!KED RLLY MAY NEED TO ADD SOMETHING IF ALOT OF THESE ARE JUST CAUSED BY BAD CHEKSMS IDK IF THAT EVER BE THE CASE IN NORMAL USE THOU SO IDK
