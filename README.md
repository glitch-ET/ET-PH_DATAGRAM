- **FIELD_UNIT**: ONE OF THE SBC THAT RUNS TASKAND TURNS IN RPTs TO TIMEKEEPER
---
- **TIMEKEEPER/TASKMASTER**: MAY END UP BEING DIFRENT JOBS LATER NOW ITS THE CENTRAL 
HUB THE SERVER THE TIMEKEEPER USEING A SLIGHTLY TWEEKED CHROND AND CRONTABS FOR EACH
DIFRENT UNITS OR GROUPS OF UNITS */* I WOULD LIKE TOGET SOME KINDA PROGRAM THAT WILL 
IN ALIGNING ORGINIZEING AND THE DIFRENT CRHOND EVENTS SO BECEAUSE IF 2 OR 10 FEILD_UNITS
ALL NEED MSGS AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN SIMPLIFY MATTERS */* IM GONA STOP TALKING
BOUT TIMEKEEPER RN MORE ON ITS READ ME WHEN I GET TO IT. 
----
- **TASK**: A SCRIPT THAT IS RAN BY THE FIELD_UNIT ITS KNOWN BY  FOR NOW IM GONNA
GO WITH 2 OCTAL NUMBER THATS 12 BITS 4068 COMBINATIONS I BELIVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
---
- **SCHEMA/RPT**: IM PUTTING THESE TOUGTHER BECAUSE THERE MOSTLY THE SAME THEY WILL HAVE A JSON FORMAT SCHEMA THAT IS MORE HUMAN FREANDLY THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT USE ID MAKE NEW ONES ITS NOT DIRECTLY USED BY THE COMPUTERS THEY STILL NEED ONE BECAUSE ITS HARD TO KNOW WERE ONE THING STOPS AND NEXT STARTS IN BINARY WHEN YA DONT KNOW THE SIZE OF THOSE THINGSSAME DEAL AS THE TASKS 4 OCTL NUMBERS
THIS IS START OF THE MSG SYSTEM IM WORKING ON IT IS DESINED FOR THE IIoT WORLD
SPECIFICLY FOR MY ELECTRIC TERRARIUM PROJECT WITCH IS A FOR MONITERING AND 
MAINTAINING MICRO CONTROLLED CLIMETE INDOOR OR GREENHOUSED PLANTS MICRO GREEN
AND LIKE MUSHROOM CULTIVATION TERRARIUMS AQURERIUMS ECT. YOU MAY THINK ITS A 
OVERLY BROAD TARGET BUT 1 ITS A FRAMEWORK 2 ITS REALY A CLIMET CONTROL SYSTEM 
THAT IS BUILT FOR MULTIPLE FEILD UNITS MEANING DIFFRENT SETUPS CAN BE COMPLETLY
DIFRENT OR COULD ALL BE THE SAME JUST DIFRENT UNITS THE BRAINS BEHINFD EACH UNIT
CAN BE A SMALL SBC ESP32-C3 LONG AS THERES NO VAMREA MONITERING THATS BOUGTH WAT 
THIS IS ACHIVABLE BECAUSE TIMEING DATA STORAGE TO USER COMM AND SO ON IS RLLY THEN
JOB OF A CENTRAL TIMEKEEPER/TASKMASTER CENTRAL UNIT THAT DOSE THE SCHEDULING 
VIA CHROND CHRONTABS OR A MODIFIYED VERSOIN OF SUCH AND COMINICATING WITH THIS ET-PH
A ULTRA LIGHT WEIGHT UDP BASED PROTOCAL THAT USES SMALL FORMAT MSGS THAT USE RESENSENDS
SERILIZED BINARY SCHEMAD MSG MEANING THAT THE INFORMATION IS SENT WHITHOUT ANY LABELS
META INFORMATION ALSO PRETTY ANY OPTION IS GOING TO BE NUMERICAL 

----
## MSG HEADER
_____
THATS HOW WE GET TO THE WHAT I HAVE COMPLETED SO FAR MSG_TYPE A EXP_TYPE THAT IS THE 
FIRST AND SECOND PART OF THE ACTUAL MSG HEADER AFTER THE EXISTING IP AND UDP 
WITCH SOME OF THAT WILL BE USED AS I PREVIOUSLY STATED THE SOURCE AND DESTINATION 
IP IN THE IP HEADER AND PORT IN UDP HEADER ALSO THE UDP HEADER COINTAINS A DATGRAM 
CHECKSUM AND MSG LEAGTH FOR THE ENTIRE MSG WITCH IS ALSO GOING TO BE USED 
IN ITS COMPLETE FOR THE MSG HEADER IS GOING TO BE LESS THEN 64 BITS 8 BYTES AND
IN SOME CASES THAT WILL BE THE MSG IF THERE IS A PAYLOAD IT WILL BE A CMD  
WITCH IS MORE OF A CMD REFRENCE SENT BY THE TIMEKEEPER THE ACTUAL SCRIPT THAT
NEEDS TO BE RAN WILL BE STORED SOME WHGERE FOR THE FEILD UNIT TO PULL LOAD RUN 
LIKE ON SD CARD OR BOSSIBLY EXTERNAL HARDDRIVE THAT COULD STORE DIFRENT SCRIPTS FOR
 A FEW DIFRENT UNITS SOME
